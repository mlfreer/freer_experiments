Consider the two options that are shown below.

<br><br>

<b> Option A </b>: 100% chance of £{{safe_payoff}}

<br><br>

<b> Option B </b>: 50% chance of £{{low_payoff}} and 50% chance of £{{high_payoff}}

<br><br>

We will ask you to tell us which option you prefer.

<br><br>

There is a {{payment_probability}}% chance that you will be paid based on your response.

<br><br>

If you are paid based on your response and you chose Option A, then you would receive a payment of £15.

<br><br>

If you are paid based on your response and you chose Option B, then the computer would flip a fair coin to determine your payment.  You would be equally likely to receive either £{{low_payoff}} or £{{high_payoff}}.
