Welcome to the <b>ESSEXLab!</b> You have earned <b>Â£5 for showing up on time</b>. Please abstain from using any personal electronic devices (including phones, tablets, and headphones) as well as communicating with other players while the experiment is in progress.

<br> 
<br>

<ul>
	<li> You will be playing 10 rounds following the rules explained below. </li>
	<li>	One round is chosen for payment at random. </li>
	<li>	You can earn up to 30 pounds depending on the round chosen for payment. </li>
	<li>	Before the experiment begins you will choose a user name that will be your virtual identity throughout the experiment. </li>
</ul>




<h3> Structure of a Round </h3>

<ul>
	<li>	You will be <b>randomly assigned to a group of four participants</b> each round. </li>
	<li>	You and the other group members will </b>compete in a tournament</b>. </li>
	<li>	Each round of the experiment consists of three stages: 	</li>
	<ol>
		<li>	Effort Stage </li>
		<li>	Investment Stage </li>
		<li>	Tournament Outcome Stage </li>
	</ol>
	<li>	We now describe the three stages in more detail. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Effort Stage </h3>

<ul>
	<li>	You will see a <b>set of sliders</b> on your screen. </li>
	</li>	You can adjust each slider to any position between 0 and 100 by pressing the slider with your mouse and dragging it to the desired position. </li>
	<li>	You have <b>one minute</b> to adjust <b>as many sliders as possible</b> to the target position of 50. </li>
	<li>	You will receive <b>one token for each correctly adjusted slider</b>. </li>
	<li>	At the end of the experiment, tokens will be converted to pounds at the following exchange rate: 
	<br>

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">
<b> 1 token = 50p. </b>
</div>
	</li>
</ul>


<h3> Investment Stage </h3>

<ul>
	<li>	You decide how many of your previously earned tokens to keep and how many of your tokens to <b>invest in training</b>. </li>
	<li>	Training determines your performance in the tournament. </li>
	<li>	Each token invested in training increases your tournament score by one point. </li>
	<li>	For example, if you <b>received 21 tokens from the task</b> and <b>invested 10 tokens</b> in training, then your tournament <b>score is 10</b> and you will be <b>paid 11 tokens </b> if the round is chosen for payment. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Tournament Outcome Stage </h3>

<ul>
	<li>	Once everyone has concluded with their investment you will see <b>the rank</b> you achieved in the tournament along with <b>usernames, investments, and ranks for other group members</b> as on the screenshot below.
<br>
<img class="pic-center" src="{{ static 'pictures/CardinalVisibility.png' }}"/>
	</li>

<li>	The outcome stage contains <b> your rank, username, and investment </b>.  </li>

</ul>
<h3> Timeline of an Experimental Round </h3>

<ol>
	<li>	At the beginning of each round, you are randomly assigned to <b> a group of four participants </b> who will compete with each other in a tournament. </li>
	<li>	In the Effort Stage, you have <b> one minute to adjust as many sliders as possible </b> to the target position of 50, and you earn <b> one token for each correctly adjusted slider </b>. </li>
	<li>	In the Investment Stage, you decide how many of your earned tokens to keep and how many tokens to invest in training.  <b> Training determines your performance in the tournament </b>.  Each token invested increases your tournament score by one point. </li>
	<li>	In the Tournament Outcome Stage, your tournament score will be <b>compared</b> to the <b> scores of other group members </b>.  Your ranking will be shown, from 1 (highest score) to 4 (lowest score). </li>
</ol>

Then you proceed to the next round. At the end of the experiment, one round is randomly selected for payment. <b>You receive 50p for each token you have at the end of that round</b>.

<br>
<br>

<h3> Payment: </h3>

<ul>
	<li>	Once the experiment is finished one of the rounds would be randomly selected for payment. </li>
	<li>	All rounds are equally likely to be selected thus please take them seriously. </li>
	<li>	All payments are conducted electronically using the Tremendous system. </li>
</ul>
