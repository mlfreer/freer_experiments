Welcome to the <b>ESSEXLab!</b> You have earned <b>Â£5 for showing up on time</b>. Please abstain from using any personal electronic devices (including phones, tablets, and headphones) as well as communicating with other players while the experiment is in progress.

<br> 
<br>

<ul>
	<li> You will be playing 15 rounds following the rules explained below. </li>
	<li>	You can earn up to 30 pounds depending on the round chosen for payment. </li>
	<li>	Before the experiment begins you will choose a user name that will be your <b>virtual identity</b> throughout the experiment. </li>
</ul>




<h3> Structure of a Round </h3>

You will be randomly assigned to a group of four participants, which will remain the same for the entire experiment. 
Each round, you and the other members of your group will collect decorative objects called decals, and will compare collections.
Each round consists of three stages, which are detailed below.

<br>
<br>

<h3> Stage 1. </h3>

<ul>
	<li>	You will see a set of sliders on your screen. </li>
	</li>	You can adjust each slider to any position between 0 and 100 by clicking and dragging with your mouse. </li>
	<li>	You have one minute to adjust as many sliders as possible to the target position of 50. </li>
	<li>	You will earn one token for each correctly adjusted slider. </li>
</ul>


<h3> Stage 2. </h3>


<ul>
	<li>	You can purchase digital decals at a cost of one token per decal:
<img  width="15%" src="{{ static 'pictures/decal.png' }}"/>
 </li>
	<li>	Decals have no monetary value and will not affect your final payment. </li>
	<li>	For example, if you earn 21 tokens from Stage 1 and choose to purchase 10 decals, you will be paid 11 tokens if that round is selected for payment.
 </li>
</ul>

<h3> Stage 3. </h3>

<ul>
	<li> After all participants have made their purchasing decisions, you will proceed to the outcome stage. </li>
	<li> You will see a table displaying your decals purchase decisions alongside those of your group members. </li>
<br>
<img class="pic-center" width="80%" src="{{ static 'pictures/CardinalVisibility.png' }}"/>
	</li>
	<li>Other participants will also see your consumption decision. </li>
	<li>You will then move on to the next round. </li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>

<h3> Payment: </h3>

<ul>
	<li>	Once the experiment concludes, one round will be randomly selected for payment. </li>
	<li>	Each round has an equal chance of being chosen, so please take them seriously, as a significant amount of money is at stake. </li>
	<li>	At the end of the experiment, tokens will be converted to pounds at the following exchange rate:
		<br>
	<p align="center">
		<b>1 token = 50 pence</b>
	</p>
 </li>
</ul>
