In this task you will be asked to count zeros in a series of tables.
The figure shows the work screen you will use later:

[SCREENSHOT HERE]

<br><br>

Enter the number of zeros into the box on the right side of the screen. After you have entered the number, click the <b>Validate</b> button. Once you press the button the new matrix will be generated. The new matrix will be generated regardless whether you input correct or wrong number of zeros.

<br><br>

<b> Counting tips:</b> Of course you can count the zeros any way you want. Speaking from
experience, however, it is helpful to always count two zeros at once and multiply the
resulting number by two at the end. In addition you miscount less frequently if you track
the number you are currently counting with the mouse cursor.
