In this study you will be asked to complete five different tasks.

<br><br>

<br><br>

The method we use to determine your earnings varies across tasks. Before each task, we will describe in detail how your payment is determined.

<br><br>

Your total earnings from the experiment are the sum of your payment for the randomly selected task and your Â£5,- payment for completing all tasks.

<br><br>

At the end of the experiment, you will be asked to come to the side room where you will be paid in private.
