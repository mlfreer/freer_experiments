In this study you will be asked to complete four different tasks. 

<br><br>

None of these tasks will take more than <b>5 minutes</b>. At the end of the study you will receive £4,- for having completed the four tasks. In addition, we will randomly select one of the tasks and pay you based on your performance in that task. Once you have completed all four tasks, we will determine which task counts for payment by drawing a number between 1 and 4. 
<br><br>

The method we use to determine your earnings varies across tasks. Before each task, we will describe in detail how your payment is determined. 

<br><br>

Your total earnings from the experiment are the sum of your payment for the randomly selected task and your £ 4,- payment for completing all tasks. 

<br><br>

At the end of the experiment, you will be asked to come to the side room where you will be paid in private.
