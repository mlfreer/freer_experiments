For Task {{ task_number }}, again you will be given <b>5 minutes</b> to find the correct number of zeros displayed in a series of {% if discriminated == 1 %} <b> large </b> {% else %} <b> small </b> {% endif %}tables. However, for this task, you will be able to choose your payments scheme. 
You can choose either <b>Payment Scheme {% if alt1 == 0 %} A {% endif %} </b> or <b>Payment Scheme</b> {% if alt2 == 0%} <b> A </b> {% elif alt2 == 1 %} <b> B </b> {% elif alt2 == 2 %} <b> C </b> {% elif alt2 == 3 %} <b> D </b> {% endif %}

        If Task {{ task_number }} is randomly selected for payment, then you will get <b>£{{ b_wage }} per correct answer</b>. Your payment does not decrease if you provide an incorrect answer to a problem. We refer to this payment as the <b>Payment Scheme A</b>.

If Task {{ task_number }} is randomly selected for payment, then your performance will be evaluated relative to the performance of the other three participants in your group. The payment will depend on the number of your correct answers compared to the number of correct answers of the three other participants. 

<br><br>

You are participating in the group of four participants.
Your group consists of two types of participants. 

<br><br>

<ul>
    <li> There are two participants who have to find zeros in a series of small ({{small_x}}x{{all_y}}) tables </li>
    <li> There are two participants who have to find zeros in a series of large ({{large_x}}x{{all_y}}) tables  </li>
</ul>

You performance will be compared against the performance of the other participants in the corresponding round.
Thus you decision and performance will not affect their payoff for this task.


<br><br>

<ul>
    <li> The two participants who correctly solve the largest number of problems will receive £{{w_wage}},- per correct answer. </li>
    <li> The other two participants will not receive any payment. </li>
</ul>

You will not be informed of how you did in the tournament until all tasks have been completed. If there are ties, the winners will be randomly determined.


            {% elif alt2 == 2 %}

If Task {{ task_number }} is randomly selected for payment, then your performance will be evaluated relative to the performance of the other three participants in your group. The payment will depend on the number of your correct answers compared to the number of correct answers of the three other participants.

    <li> There are two participants who have to find zeros in a series of large ({{large_x}}x{{all_y}}) tables  </li>
</ul>

You performance will be compared against the performance of the other participants in the corresponding round.
Thus you decision and performance will not affect their payoff for this task.

<br><br>

In addition, the following rule will be applied: The <b>score</b> of participants solving large tables is given by the <b>number of correctly solved tables multiplied by {{multiplier}}</b>. The <b>score</b> for participants solving small tables is given by the <b>number of correctly solved tables</b>. 

<br><br>

<ul>
    <li> The two participants who correctly solve the largest number of problems will receive £{{w_wage}},- per correct answer. </li>
    <li> The other two participants will not receive any payment. </li>
</ul>

You will not be informed of how you did in the tournament until all tasks have been completed. If there are ties, the winners will be randomly determined.

            {% elif alt2 == 3 %}

If Task {{ task_number }} is randomly selected for payment, then your performance will be evaluated relative to the performance of the other three participants in your group. The payment will depend on the number of your correct answers compared to the number of correct answers of the three other participants.

In addition, the following rule will be applied: {{tax}}%  of the earnings of each of the two participants who correctly solved the largest number of problems will be equally distributed among the other two participants. 

<br><br>

You will not be informed of how you did in the tournament until all tasks have been completed. If there are ties, the winners will be randomly determined.
