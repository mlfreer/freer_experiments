<b> Welcome to the experiment! </b>
<br>
Welcome to ESSEXLab and thank you for participating in today’s experiment.
Please place all of your personal belongings away so that we can have your complete attention.
Please use the computer only as instructed. In particular, do not attempt to browse the web or use programs unrelated to the experiment.

<br><br>

<b>Guidelines</b>
<br>
You will be paid in private and in cash at the end of the experiment.
The amount of money that you ultimately earn in the experiment depends on your decisions, the decisions of others and random chance.
You have each earned a £5 payment for showing up on time.
Please DO NOT socialize or talk during the experiment.

<br><br>

<b>Structure of the Experiment</b>
<br>
The experiment consists of two blocks.
One round in each of the blocks will be randomly selected to determine your

You will be instructed on each block separately prior to it's beginning.
