This is an experiment in decision-making. Your payoffs will depend partly only on your decisions and
partly on chance. It will not depend on the decisions of the other participants in the
experiments. Please pay careful attention to the instructions as a considerable amount of
money is at stake.

<br><br>

You have earned the £4 of participation payment just for coming on time for the experiment.
You also have a chance to earn up to £25 by participating in the experiment.
The experiment consists of two blocks, that contain two types of decision problems.
The first block consists of 30 decision problems.
The second block consists of 20 decision problems.

<br><br>

Your earnings in the experiment are determined as follows. 
At the end of the experiment, the computer will randomly select one decision round from each block to carry out for payment.
The rounds selected depend solely upon chance. 
For each block, it is equally likely that any round will be chosen.
