    	<b> Structure of the Block </b>
    	<br>
    	This block consists of 30 rounds.
    	One of the 30 rounds will be randomly selected to determine your payment.
    	Each round is equally likely to be selected.
    	Thus, it is important for you to take each round seriously.

    	<br><br>

    	<b> Structure of the Round </b>
    	<br>
    	In this block you will need to choose between lotteries.
    	Each lottery consists of two possible prizes, both prizes being equally likely.
    	For example if you choose the lottery 50% chance of £X and 50% chance of £Y, then if a (fair virtual) coin lands Heads you will receive £X and if it lands Tails you will receive £Y.
