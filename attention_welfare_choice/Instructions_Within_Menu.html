    	Here we present the instructions for the first block of the experiment.
    	Please read the instructions carefully as the considerable amount of money is at stake.
    	In addition, you would be asked couple of questions as a comprehension check.
    	You would only be able to start the experiment upon completing the comprehension check.

    	<br><br>

    	In this block you will be presented with a choice between risky prospects.
    	Each risky prospect has two potential outcomes depending: Heads and Tails.
    	Both outcomes are equally likely and which of them is realized depends on the throw of the virtual coin in the end of the experiment.
    	You will be presented with the <b>menus</b> consisting of either <b>two</b> or <b>three alternatives</b>.
    	
    	<br><br>

    	<img style="float: center; max-width: 100%;max-height: 100%;" src="{{ static 'pictures/doubletone.png' }}"/>
    	<div class="caption" style="float: center; text-align: center;"><b> Fig.1: Example interface of choice from menu with two options </b></div>

    	<br>

		<img style="float: center; max-width: 100%;max-height: 100%;" src="{{ static 'pictures/tripletone.png' }}"/>
		<div class="caption" style="float: center; text-align: center;"><b> Fig.2: Example interface of choice from menu with three options </b></div>

    	<br><br>

    	You can see the example of both interfaces below.
    	You pick the alternative simply by clicking on it.
    	Upon making the decision you would be automatically transfered to the next decision problem.

    	<br><br>

    	In the example with two alternatives, if you decide to pick one on the left.
    	If the alternative on the left is realized for payment and the state of the outcome is Heads, then your payment would be £X.
    	If the state of the outcome is Tails, the your payment would be £Y.
