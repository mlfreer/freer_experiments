    	<b> Structure of the Block </b>
    	<br>
    	This block consists of 30 rounds.
    	One of the 30 rounds will be randomly selected to determine your payment.
    	All rounds are equally likely to be selected.
    	Thus, it is important for you to take each round seriously.

    	<br><br>

    	<b> Structure of the Round </b>
    	<br>
    	In this block you choose between options.
    	There are two equally likely states of the world: Heads and Tails. 
    	The actual state will be determined by a virtual coin flip (using the computer’s random number generator).
    	For example if you choose the left option, then you will receive £9 if the coin comes up Heads, and will receive £7 if the coin comes up Tails.
