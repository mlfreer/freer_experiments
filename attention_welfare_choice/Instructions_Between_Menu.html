    	Here we present the instructions for the second block of the experiment.
    	Please read the instructions carefully as the considerable amount of money is at stake.
    	In addition, you would be asked couple of questions as a comprehension check.
    	You would only be able to start the experiment upon completing the comprehension check.

    	<br><br>

    	In this block you will be presented with a choice between menus containing risky prospects.
    	Each risky prospect has two potential outcomes depending: Heads and Tails.
    	Both outcomes are equally likely and which of them is realized depends on the throw of the virtual coin in the end of the experiment.
    	In each decision problem you will be presented with two options (menus).

    	<div class="caption" style="float: center; text-align: center;"><b> Fig.1: Example interface of choice between menus </b></div>

		<br><br>

		Each menu is split into two parts, as shown on the screenshot above.
		The bottom part list the options available in the manu.
		The top part presents the choice you have made from this menu in Block I.
		That is, in the example above if we consider the menu on the right, there were three alternatives present:
		
		<ul style="list-style-type: none">
			<li> 50% chance of winning £X and 50% chance of winning £Y,
			<li> 50% chance of winning £X and 50% chance of winning £Y,
			<li> 50% chance of winning £X and 50% chance of winning £Y.
		</ul>

		The alternative chosen was:
		<ul style="list-style-type: none">
			<li> 50% chance of winning £X and 50% chance of winning £Y.
		</ul>

		However, upon choosing the menu you do not have an option to revise the choice from the Block I.
		That is, if you choose the menu on the left, then the corresponding chosen alternative would be 
		<ul style="list-style-type: none">
			<li> 50% chance of winning £X and 50% chance of winning £Y.
		</ul>
