For Task {{ task_number }}, you will be given 5 minutes to find the correct number of zeros displayed in a series of {% if discriminated == 1 %} <b> large </b> {% else %} <b> small </b> {% endif %} tables. For this task, your payment depends on your performance relative to a group of other participants. Each group consists of four people currently participating in this study. The composition of this group is fixed throughout this study. 

<br><br>

Your group consists of two types of participants. 

<br><br>

<ul>
	<li> There are two participants who have to find zeros in a series of small ({{small_x}}x{{all_y}}) tables </li>
	<li> There are two participants who have to find zeros in a series of large ({{large_x}}x{{all_y}}) tables  </li>
</ul>

<b>Reminder</b>: You will have to find the correct number of zeros in a {% if discriminated == 1 %} <b> large </b> {% else %} <b> small </b> {% endif %} table.

<br><br>

If Task {{ task_number }} is randomly selected for payment, then your performance will be evaluated relative to the performance of the other three participants in your group. The payment will depend on the number of your correct answers compared to the number of correct answers of the three other participants. 

<br><br>

<ul>
	<li> The two participants who correctly solve the largest number of problems will receive Â£{{w_wage}},- per correct answer. </li>
	<li> The other two participants will not receive any payment. </li>
</ul>

In addition, the following rule will be applied: {{tax}}%  of the earnings of each of the two participants who correctly solved the largest number of problems will be equally distributed among the other two participants.

We refer to this as <b>Payment Scheme D</b>. You will not be informed of how you did in the tournament until all tasks have been completed. If there are ties, the winners will be randomly determined.
