 If this task is the one randomly selected for payment, then your earnings depend on the number of problems you solve compared to the three other people in your group. The two individuals who correctly solve the largest number of problems will receive £{{w_wage}} per correct problem, while the other participants receive £{{l_wage}} per correrct problem. We refer to this as the tournament payment. You will not be informed of how you did in the tournament until all four tasks have been completed. If there are ties the winners will be randomly determined.
