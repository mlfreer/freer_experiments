Stages 1, 2 and 3, and the payment procedure, are as before, but from now on, each period will include a new stage as follows.

<br>
<br>

<h3> New Stage: </h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		After seeing the outcome of Stage 2, you have the opportunity to revise the number of decals you purchased in Stage 2. 
	</li>
	<li>
		You can increase, decrease or keep the same number of decals.
	</li>
	<li>
		After you and the other 3 participants made their revisions, the computer will randomly choose to implement the revision of one of the 4 participants. 
	</li>
	<li> 
		This means, in every round, there is a 25% chance that the final outcome table will include your revised choice, but not those of the other 3 participants; their choices would be unchanged.  
	</li>
	<li>
		You will then move to the next round.
	</li>
</ul>
